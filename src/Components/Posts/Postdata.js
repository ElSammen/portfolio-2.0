      "After putting the final touches on the first draft of my first freelance project, I figured I'd start blogging(?)/writing posts about my coding journey, idle hands and all that. I don't really expect that anyone reads these [2], more a way of keeping myself accountable and tracking my progress semi-publically - and maybe land a book deal.

    paragraph2: ["The recent commission was a single page website for a local artist, a one stop shop with all their contact details, some information, and a sample of their tracks on a custom audio player.
